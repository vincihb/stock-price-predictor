# Stock Price Predictor
A project to construct heatmaps of stock tickers mentioned on key reddit threads and perform sentiment analysis.

To run Markov chains, please run `python3 experiments/himesh/mc_report.py`. It will create a report in `client/compiled` folder.

## Required setup:
### Populate the config directory
Add a reddit_api.json file with the details from your reddit scraper account
```json
{
  "username": "...",
  "password": "...",
  "id": "...",
  "secret": "..."
}
```

Add a stock_api.json file with your api key for AlphaVantage
```json
{
  "API_KEY": "..."
}
```

At the end your project should look like:
```
glowing-pancake-praw/
    ...
    config/
        reddit_api.json
        stock_api.json
    ...
```
